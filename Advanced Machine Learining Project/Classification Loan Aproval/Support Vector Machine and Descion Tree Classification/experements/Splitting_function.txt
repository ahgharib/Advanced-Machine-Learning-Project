def split_data(preprocessed_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
    """
    Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.

    Parameters:
    - preprocessed_data: The preprocessed data after scaling and preprocessing.
    - test_size: The proportion of the dataset to include in the test split (default is 0.2).
    - random_state: Controls the shuffling applied to the data before splitting (default is 42).

    Returns:
    - X_train_scaled: The features of the training set.
    - X_test_scaled: The features of the testing set.
    - y_train: The target values of the training set.
    - y_test: The target values of the testing set.
